At its height, a period extending from the middle of the 16th century to the beginning of the 18th, the Mughal Empire controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent, marshaling vast amounts of money and manpower. The best-known members of the Mughal dynasty are its first emperorsâ€”Babur and five of his lineal descendants: Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb. These six emperors are sometimes collectively known as the Great Mughals, and the military, artistic, and political glories of the empire are inextricably connected to their individual biographies.
