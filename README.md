To us the key role of an ontology is to identify
areas of knowledge, associate these areas of knowledge with other areas, and demarcate these areas
with key terms. The practical import of an ontology is to create systems for storing and retrieving
fragments of knowledge; for example, an ontological understanding of a subject allows one to under-
stand inter-dependence of certain key concepts, and related keywords, and the independence of other
concepts. The dependencies, or otherwise, may help in query expansion through the detailed specifica-
tion of ‘objects’ within a knowledge base.
