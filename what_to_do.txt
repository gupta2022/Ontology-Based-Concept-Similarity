1. use wikipedia for relation extraction 

first task is to desighn a tool to compute the distance between two nodes,
what we did in first paper was using similar words , now do we have to use the same (most probably not)
--> we will use content to find the distance or some other thing.
## we will be using wikidata for this task
2. Graph levelling . 

Easy graph algorithms , can be easilty implemented..
