For creating the knowledge graph the following procedure was adopted:
1. First the given data was broken into sentences using the PunktSentenceTokenizer in the nltk library.
2. Each word of every sentence is then tagged (Part of speech tagging) using the pos_tag feature in nltk library.
3. Then a rule of as to how to select the entities was made (adjective , followed by noun ) was made to select the entities in each sentence of the data.
4. Given the rule a RegexpParser was made to parse the entire Sentence and chunk the words that were following the rules together using the nltk library.
5. After getting the chunked data the chunks were extracted using regex and basic string algorithms.
6. Then graphs algorithms are used to connect the chunks extracted to each other.
7. After this , the nodes are fed into a pandas data frame and networkx library is used to create a graphs
8. After the graph is created matplotlib is used to show the created graph.
