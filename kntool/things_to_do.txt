relation extraction from text is possible?
Concept realation maybe using wikipedia?
Wiki graph somehow useful?
Search each concept, parse its content and then decide which is above or which is below?


Major Problem could be , content parsing might disturb or end the levels formed
eg topic a ---> topic b
   topic a ---> topic c
   but if the relation between c is not discovered then b==c but originally topic b ---> topic c.

Can we do it without wikipedia or any text corpora??
I dont think it is possible as it is imppossible to get the knowlege of what is above which.

relations???
1> superclass , subparts ==> wikipedia.
2> NLP ... == 1/0
