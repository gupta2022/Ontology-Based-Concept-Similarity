The main aim of this project is to form a knowledge graph from a given set of
materials to identify concept similarity between different words from that 
set of materials

According to the done research it can be done in the following way

Our first step should be to make an ontology from the given materials --> and then decide upon it's matching strategies

The ontology graph (knowledge graph ) can be made using 
3 things of each word:

1. hyponyms
2. synonyms
3.  named individuals

and then we have to define different matching strategies which can be used:

1. direct matching strategy
2. other customised matching strategy
